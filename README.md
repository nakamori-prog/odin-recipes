This is my first attempt at building a basic HTML webpage, complete with a main index page and links to a few recipes.

Upon completion, I hope to have demonstrated my understanding of basic HTML elements and concepts, as well as develop a foundation for more advanced web development projects in the future.

These basic concepts/skills include:

- ability to write HTML boilerplate from memory
- ability to use basic HTML elements (i.e. <p>, <strong>/<em>, <a>, etc.)
- ability to use both absolute and relative links successfully

To my future self: I hope you're doing okay!
