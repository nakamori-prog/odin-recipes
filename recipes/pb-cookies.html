                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Peanut butter</li>
                <li>Sugars (both white and brown)</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.</li>
                <li>Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour to make it easier to work with.</li>

                <li>Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
